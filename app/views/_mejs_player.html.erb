Here we can pull in Webpacked files (js, css, images) directly into whichever rails view
is using the code.

The tags below are referencing 'app/javascript/packs/application.js', which is the default Webpack entrance file. This default entry point is a manifest of sorts to pull in additional application files.

So maybe a way to set this up is to have a 'app/javascript/packs/mejs_avalon.js' specific file, which is
included with one or two lines (as shown below), in whichever view needs it.

So if a page/view doesn't need the Mediaelement player code, it doesn't have to download it.
